# Python-Packet-Sniffing
My goal with this small project is to learn about packets, my own wi-fi network, and how to analyze traffic.
Run the script with: 
source venv/bin/activate  # Activates the virtual environment
sudo python3 sniffer.py en0 verbose

I am using a virtual environment as to not have to install the geoIP dictionary
